    "> For this project, I have chosen the data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and the U.S Census Data. The NICS is used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. The statistics in this dataset originally represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS. They do not represent the number of firearms sold. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO \"The Trace (2015), THE FBI'S NICS NUMBERS ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED AS THE BEST PROXY FOR TOTAL GUN SALES IN A GIVEN TIME PERIOD. All analysis that will be carried out with this dataset will be considered related to Gun Sales.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The U.S Census Data is also to provide demographic data about the U.S States. Statistics from this dataset will be referenced in this project for more insight.\n",
    "\n",
    ">I aim to answer four (4) questions as I Investigate this dataset.\n",
    ">1. What is the trend of Gun Sales across the U.S States?\n",
    ">2. Can the Per Capita Income of a State reveal how guns are Purchased?\n",
    ">3. Are the number of veterans in a State indicative of guns in the state?\n",
    ">4. What is the Race distribution of the State with the highest number of Guns"
